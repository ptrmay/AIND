The three score functions which I implemented are supposed to maximize the number of own moves and to minimze the moves of the opponent at the same time. But each function defines a different weight/importance to the remaining own moves respectively opponent's moves. Hence if the weights of the remaining own moves are relatively high in comparison to the weights of the opponent's remainig moves, the player will try to move to fields which offer mainly many remaining moves, which means to move away from the opponent. If the weights are distributed the other way round, the player will try to \"chase\" the opponent and isolate him.\n",
